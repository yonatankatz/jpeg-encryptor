# jpeg-encryptor
This project shows how to encrypt / decrypt a jpeg format, while the following is preserved:
- The file size remains the same
- The encrypted file remains valid as a jpeg as well

## Why should I use it?
There are better ways to encrypt a file - no matter if it's a jpeg or any other format (not necessarily an image).
Using this algorithm allows you to enctypt a jpeg file - and still **all image viewers will be able to see this image**, read it, and show
some kind of image.

## How to use it?
A simple way to start is to clone the repository, open the eclipse project and run the main function located in class
    
    jonateam.encryptor.JPEGEncryptor

Also, the two main functions - encryptFile(..) and decryptFile(..) - are located there. You can use them directly from your code.
